# Telecom-Churn-Prediction
Problem statement:-
To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, we will analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.

Retaining high profitable customers is the main business goal here.

Steps:-
Reading, understanding and visualising the data
Preparing the data for modelling
Building the model
Evaluate the model
